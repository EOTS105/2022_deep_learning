In 2022, I enrolled in a university course titled "Introduction to Deep Learning". 
As is was usually in my Electrical Engineering courses, I anticipated another math-intensive course. 
While the class did delve into the intricate mathematics underlying many Deep Learning models,
I was pleasantly surprised with its emphasis on practical application. 
This course proved to be one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my university career, and I learned a lot from it. 
I hope you find reviewing the outcomes of my studies as enjoyable as I found producing them.

In this repository, you will find 5 folders:

1. People and Vehicle Classifier - I trained the YOLOv7 model to classify people and vehicles, a contribution that would eventually support Elbit in a confidential project. Due to data limitations, we augmented the available dataset.
3. Music Century Classifier - I built a model to predict the century in which a piece of music was released.
4. Word Prediction - My neural network predicts the next word in a sentence based on the preceding three words.
5. Shoe Pairs - Predict whether two shoes are from the same pair or different pairs.
6. Face Generator - Generate new human faces using a dataset of faces.
